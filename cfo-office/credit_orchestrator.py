credit_orchestrator.py - The CFO of the credit (LendingClub) office.

Runs the lending close as a staged operating model (credit_stages) with two-tier
HITL: each function signed off by its domain expert (first line), then the CFO
gives the final consolidated sign-off and the board narrative. Numbers come from
credit_core (deterministic); the model only narrates. Persists to cfo_state.json.
